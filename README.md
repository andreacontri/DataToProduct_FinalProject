Data Product to Visualize Environmental and Economic Data: An interactive visualisation that allows the exploration of various country data over time (namely, CO2 emissions, GDP and renewables)

The Problem
Our world currently is being driven by data and the insights provided by it. With vast amounts of data revolving
around environmental and economic factors, we are presented with a unique opportunity to not only understand
but also communicate this data. This report outlines the development of a data visualisation tool that is
intuitive and accessible to a wide range of stakeholders, from the general public to experts in policy-making
and science. We have looked at a range of metrics under the umbrella of CO2 emissions, renewable energy
and GDP for countries over the years. This application aims to allow users to identify trends in data, have
more informed discussions on topics surrounding climate change and, eventually, be able to predict how
countries will perform in the future.

The Solution
The final visualization is shown in Figure 1. It’s formed by two columns. In the left column, the user can select
the country, the sub-section and the final parameter through three dropdown menus. At the bottom of the
column, there is a panel that plots the timeline data for the chosen parameter and country. The second column
shows the map of the world, with three panels on top: the legend, the country information, and the year slider.
By sliding the year, the user can visualize the data of that year on the map. The user can also view more
specific information on a country by hovering and clicking directly on the map. All panels are reactive and
automatically updated based on the different user inputs. The map panels can also be dragged around within
the boundaries of the map. A “How to Use” button is also available on the top right of the page, toggling an
instructions pop-up.

This visualisation aims to improve the understanding of environmental and economic data for our wide audience.
By using a tool like ours, we expect people to have more informed conversations about climate change and
make more accurate predictions of how countries will perform in the future. By representing the data in a
visual way such as this, we expect the public to understand the changes surrounding these topics and potentially
lead to behavioural changes in terms of energy usage.
We expect that if countries can see the future trajectory of their CO2 emissions or renewable energy output,
they will put in place measures to ensure they hit their targets. With COP28 just gone by and countries taking
more and more responsibility for their impact on the planet, we believe that this data product will not only help
countries keep themselves but others accountable too. These future predictions for CO2 emissions can be used
to simulate how the world will look in X number of years and hopefully influence communities to act and reduce
their carbon footprint. With companies pushing more towards being carbon neutral or positive, we can expect
them to endorse or use these sorts of visuals to encourage others to also follow suit
